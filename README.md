# Music-Store-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a music store database, designed to uncover business-critical insights from customer, sales, and music catalog data. It identifies the most valuable customers, top-performing artists, highest-revenue cities, and country-specific music preferences. The analysis also highlights spending patterns across demographics, pinpoints the best-selling genres, and reveals high-value transactions, providing a clear view of where revenue is concentrated. By connecting operational metrics with customer behavior, the project equips decision-makers with actionable intelligence to guide targeted marketing, event planning, and customer retention strategies.

It started with a simple question: Who’s at the top of our organization?
The data revealed the most senior employee by title, the figurehead of experience in the company.

From there, curiosity turned toward the customers. The country with the highest invoice count emerged, showing where the market was most active. Within that market, the top three invoice totals showed just how valuable certain transactions could be.

The spotlight then shifted to geography — identifying the city generating the most revenue, perfect for hosting a promotional music festival. That city wasn’t just about volume; it was home to our best customer, the one who had spent the most money overall.

Digging deeper, the team explored rock music fans, mapping their emails and names, and even pinpointing the top 10 rock artists dominating the dataset. A pattern appeared: some tracks lasted far beyond the average song length, suggesting a niche audience with different tastes.

In the advanced phase, the analysis crowned the best-selling artist and revealed which customers spent the most on them, uncovering superfans worth nurturing. The exploration also uncovered the most popular music genre in each country, revealing cultural differences in taste.

Finally, the team mapped the top spender in every country, identifying high-value customers globally. These weren’t just buyers; they were loyal patrons who drove the business forward.
